Machine Learning Course ProjectWriteup
Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data aboutpersonal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group ofenthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in theirbehavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particularactivity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data fromaccelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell liftscorrectly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here:
http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)
(see the section on the Weight LiftingExercise Dataset).

The data for this project come from this source: [
http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (http://groupware.les.inf.pucrio.
br/har)
]. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been verygenerous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.
What you should submit
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in thetraining set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you builtyour model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made thechoices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
Your submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describingyour analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. Itwill make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online(and you always want to make it easy on graders :-). You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20test cases available in the test data above. Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programmingassignment for automated grading. See the programming assignment for additional details.
Approach:
Our outcome variable is classe, a factor variable. For this data set, “participants were asked to perform one set of 10repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different fashions: - exactly according to the specification (ClassA) - throwing the elbows to the front (Class B) - lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C) - lowering the dumbbell onlyhalfway (Class D) - throwing the hips to the front (Class E)
Two models will be tested using decision tree and random forest. The model with the highest accuracy will be chosenas our final model.
Cross-validation
- Gokul Shah 2/3/2021
/
Cross-validation will be performed by subsampling our training data set randomly without replacement into 2subsamples: TrainTrainingSet data (75% of the original Training data set) and TestTrainingSet data (25%). Our modelswill be fitted on the TrainTrainingSet data set, and tested on the TestTrainingSet data. Once the most accurate model ischoosen, it will be tested on the original Testing data set.
Expected out-of-sample error
The expected out-of-sample error will correspond to the quantity: 1-accuracy in the cross-validation data. Accuracy isthe proportion of correct classified observation over the total sample in the TestTrainingSet data set. Expected accuracyis the expected accuracy in the out-of-sample data set (i.e. original testing data set). Thus, the expected value of theout-of-sample error will correspond to the expected number of missclassified observations/total observations in the Testdata set, which is the quantity: 1-accuracy found from the cross-validation data set.
Our outcome variable “classe” is a factor variable. We split the Training dataset into TrainTrainingSet andTestTrainingSet datasets.

Based on the graph above, we can see that each level frequency is within the same order of magnitude of each other.Level A is the most frequent while level D is the least frequent.

Decision on which Prediction Model to Use:
Random Forest algorithm performed better than Decision Trees. Accuracy for Random Forest model was 0.995 (95%CI: (0.993, 0.997)) compared to Decision Tree model with 0.739 (95% CI: (0.727, 0.752)). The Random Forests modelis choosen. The expected out-of-sample error is estimated at 0.005, or 0.5%.
